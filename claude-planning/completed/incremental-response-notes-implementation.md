# Incremental Response Notes - Implementation Complete

**Type**: Documentation
**Completed**: 2025-08-04

## Overview
Successfully implemented incremental response notes system that only creates new AI notes when customer sentiment escalates by 20+ points, saving API costs and reducing note clutter.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Sentiment Tracking to Notes
- Notes now include `[SENTIMENT_DATA: U{urgency}_A{anger}]` format
- Example: `[SENTIMENT_DATA: U45_A35]`
- Allows comparison with future messages

### 2. Created Previous Sentiment Parser
```typescript
function parsePreviousSentiment(notes: any[]): PreviousSentiment | null
```
- Finds most recent AI note
- Extracts urgency and anger scores
- Returns null if no previous AI note exists

### 3. Added New Customer Message Detection
```typescript
function hasNewCustomerMessage(threads: any[], lastNoteTime: string): boolean
```
- Checks if customer replied after last AI note
- Prevents unnecessary API calls

### 4. Implemented Escalation Logic
```typescript
function shouldCreateNewNote(current: SentimentResult, previous: PreviousSentiment | null): boolean
```
- Always creates note for first analysis
- Requires 20+ point increase in anger or urgency
- Also triggers if crossing 60-point threshold

### 5. Optimized Processing Flow
1. Check for existing AI note first
2. Check for new customer messages
3. Only call Claude API if new message exists
4. Create note only if sentiment increased significantly

## Results

### Cost Savings
- Estimated 60-70% reduction in API calls for ongoing conversations
- Only processes tickets with actual customer activity
- Skips unchanged back-and-forth conversations

### Testing Results
- Dry run on 20 tickets: 0 escalations, 0 new notes needed
- All existing conversations correctly identified and skipped
- No duplicate notes created

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ AI sentiment is primary (keywords only as backup)
- ‚úÖ Checks for new messages BEFORE analysis
- ‚úÖ Preserves ticket properties (status, assignee)
- ‚úÖ Works with existing tagging system

## Monitoring
The system logs:
- `üîÑ Previous AI note found` - when detecting existing notes
- `‚úÖ No new customer messages` - when no new activity
- `‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping - no new customer activity` - when bypassing analysis
- `üìà Sentiment escalated` - when creating new note

## Production Status
- Deployed to Vercel
- Running every 15 minutes via cron
- Monitoring via Vercel logs
