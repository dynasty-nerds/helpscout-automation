# MemberPress Integration - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Service (`src/services/memberPressService.ts`)
- Created a complete MemberPress service class with MySQL connection pooling
- Implemented key methods:
  - `getUserIdByEmail()` - Looks up user by email
  - `hasActiveTransaction()` - Checks if user has active subscription
  - `getTransactionHistory()` - Retrieves payment history
  - `getMemberPressContext()` - Gets complete subscription context

### 2. AI Integration Updates

#### Claude Client (`lib/claude-client.ts`)
- Added MemberPress-specific categorization:
  - "MemberPress Access Issue"
  - "MemberPress Billing Query"  
  - "MemberPress Cancellation"
- Added instructions for handling MemberPress data in responses
- Ensures AI says "I've checked your account" when using data

#### API Endpoint (`pages/api/scan-and-tag.ts`)
- Added automatic MemberPress lookup when keywords detected
- Fetches subscription data based on Help Scout customer email
- Includes MemberPress context in conversation history for AI

### 3. Configuration
- Updated `.env.example` with MemberPress database credentials
- Added mysql2 dependency (already in package.json)
- Created test script for verification

### 4. Documentation
- Created comprehensive integration guide (`MEMBERPRESS_INTEGRATION.md`)
- Documented use cases, configuration, and troubleshooting
- Added response examples for common scenarios

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Detection** - Triggers on keywords like "access", "billing", "cancel"
2. **Email-Based Lookup** - Uses Help Scout customer email automatically
3. **Smart Responses** - Handles various scenarios:
   - Active subscription with expiry date
   - No user found (suggests different email)
   - User exists but no transactions
   - Gateway-specific cancellation routing
4. **Transaction History** - Shows payment amounts and dates
5. **App Store Handling** - Detects iOS/Android subscriptions and provides proper instructions

## How It Works

1. Customer mentions subscription issue
2. System detects MemberPress keywords
3. Queries database using customer email
4. Adds subscription data to AI context
5. AI generates response with specific account details

## Testing

Run test script:
```bash
npm run test:memberpress
```

## Next Steps (Not Implemented)

- Actual cancellation/refund processing (currently just instructions)
- Webhook for real-time subscription updates
- Admin dashboard for manual lookups
- Metrics tracking for MemberPress queries
