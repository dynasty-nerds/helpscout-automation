# HelpScout Tagging System Documentation

## Overview
Our tagging system uses a hierarchical structure with three types of tags to categorize customer support tickets effectively. Every ticket should receive the most specific tag possible while maintaining clarity.

## Tag Types

### 1. Standalone Major Tags (Green)
These are independent category tags that don't have subcategories. Use these when the entire category is clear and specific.

### 2. Parent Major Tags (Blue)
These are category tags that have child tags beneath them. Use these only when you cannot determine the specific subcategory.

### 3. Child/Minor Tags (Purple)
These are detailed subcategories that provide specific context. Always prefer using a child tag over a parent tag when the detail is known.

## Tagging Rules

1. **Use ONE tag per ticket** (either standalone, parent, or child - never both parent and child)
2. **Prefer child tags** when you have enough information
3. **Use parent tags** only when the specific detail is unknown
4. **Add sentiment/special tags** (angry-customer, high-urgency, spam) IN ADDITION when applicable

## Decision Tree

1. **Is it spam?** â†’ Tag `spam` only
2. **Is it a standalone category?** â†’ Use standalone major tag
3. **Can you identify the specific detail?** â†’ Use child tag
4. **Detail unclear?** â†’ Use parent tag only
5. **Is customer angry or urgent?** â†’ Add sentiment tag
