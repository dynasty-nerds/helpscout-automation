# AI-Powered Response Generation & Documentation Management

**Type**: Implementation Plan

## Overview
Build an AI system that generates suggested responses based on HelpScout documentation, learns from agent modifications, and continuously improves documentation quality while staying under $100/month.

## User Need
- Generate contextual response suggestions for support tickets
- Learn from agent modifications to improve suggestions
- Keep documentation up-to-date with actual agent responses
- Identify gaps in documentation
- Optimize cost while maintaining quality

## LLM Recommendation: **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**

### Why Claude 3.5 Sonnet:
- **Cost**: ~$3 per 1M input tokens, ~$15 per 1M output tokens
- **Context**: 200K tokens (can handle full ticket history + docs)
- **Quality**: Excellent at following instructions and maintaining consistency
- **Document Understanding**: Superior at parsing and referencing documentation
- **Safety**: Built-in safety features for customer-facing content
- **Structured Output**: Great at generating JSON responses with reasoning

### Cost Estimation (200 tickets/day):
- Input: ~2K tokens/ticket × 200 × 30 = 12M tokens/month = $36
- Output: ~500 tokens/ticket × 200 × 30 = 3M tokens/month = $45
- **Total: ~$81/month** (well under budget)

## Architecture Overview

```
Ticket Update → Dedupe Check → Context Builder → Claude API → Response Generation → Agent Review → Learning Loop
                     ↓
               Documentation Sync ← Knowledge Base ← HelpScout Docs API
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. **Deduplication System**
   - Track processed threads by ID
   - Only process new customer messages
   - Store thread fingerprints in database

2. **HelpScout Docs Integration**
   - Fetch and cache documentation articles
   - Build searchable knowledge base
   - Update docs cache daily

3. **Context Builder**
   - Combine ticket history + relevant docs
   - Semantic search for relevant articles
   - Keep context under 150K tokens

### Phase 2: AI Integration (Week 3-4)
4. **Claude API Integration**
   - System prompt for response generation
   - Include documentation context
   - Generate structured responses with reasoning

5. **Response Management**
   - Store suggested responses
   - Track agent modifications
   - Link suggestions to actual responses

### Phase 3: Learning System (Week 5-6)
6. **Agent Feedback Loop**
   - Compare suggested vs actual responses
   - Extract modification patterns
   - Update prompt engineering based on patterns

7. **Documentation Intelligence**
   - Identify response patterns not covered in docs
   - Suggest new documentation sections
   - Flag outdated documentation

## Detailed Technical Design

### 1. Database Schema
```sql
-- Track processed threads to avoid duplicates
CREATE TABLE processed_threads (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  conversation_id INTEGER,
  thread_id INTEGER,
  processed_at TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(conversation_id, thread_id)
);

-- Store documentation cache
CREATE TABLE documentation_cache (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  article_id VARCHAR,
  title TEXT,
  content TEXT,
  url TEXT,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP,
  embedding VECTOR(1536) -- For semantic search
);

-- Track AI suggestions and agent responses
CREATE TABLE response_suggestions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  conversation_id INTEGER,
  thread_id INTEGER,
  suggested_response TEXT,
  reasoning TEXT,
  referenced_docs TEXT[],
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Track actual agent responses for learning
CREATE TABLE agent_responses (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  suggestion_id INTEGER REFERENCES response_suggestions(id),
  actual_response TEXT,
  modifications TEXT,
  feedback_score INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 2. System Prompt Template
```
You are a customer support AI for DynastyNerds, a fantasy football platform. Generate helpful, accurate responses based on our documentation.

CONTEXT:
- Customer Issue: {ticket_summary}
- Conversation History: {conversation_history}
- Relevant Documentation: {relevant_docs}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Generate a helpful response that addresses the customer's specific issue
2. Reference relevant documentation when applicable
3. Match the friendly, professional tone of our team
4. If information is missing from docs, note what should be added
5. Keep responses concise but complete

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "suggested_response": "The actual response text...",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "referenced_docs": ["article1", "article2"],
  "reasoning": "Why this response addresses their issue...",
  "documentation_gaps": ["Missing info about X", "Y needs clarification"],
  "response_type": "billing|technical|account|general"
}
```

### 3. Workflow Logic
```typescript
async function processNewThread(conversationId: number, threadId: number) {
  // 1. Check if already processed
  if (await isThreadProcessed(conversationId, threadId)) {
    return;
  }
  
  // 2. Get conversation context
  const conversation = await getConversationWithHistory(conversationId);
  const relevantDocs = await findRelevantDocs(conversation.content);
  
  // 3. Generate response
  const suggestion = await generateResponseSuggestion({
    conversation,
    documentation: relevantDocs
  });
  
  // 4. Store suggestion
  await storeSuggestion(conversationId, threadId, suggestion);
  
  // 5. Add note to HelpScout with suggestion
  await addSuggestionNote(conversationId, suggestion);
  
  // 6. Mark as processed
  await markThreadProcessed(conversationId, threadId);
}
```

### 4. Documentation Sync Process
```typescript
async function syncDocumentation() {
  const articles = await helpscoutDocsAPI.getArticles();
  
  for (const article of articles) {
    // Generate embeddings for semantic search
    const embedding = await generateEmbedding(article.content);
    
    await upsertDocumentation({
      articleId: article.id,
      title: article.title,
      content: article.content,
      url: article.url,
      embedding: embedding
    });
  }
}
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Smart Context Management
- Semantic search to include only relevant docs (vs all docs)
- Summarize long conversation histories
- Cache embeddings for documentation

### 2. Batching & Caching
- Process multiple tickets in single API call when possible
- Cache common responses for similar issues
- Use cheaper embeddings API for document search

### 3. Tiered Processing
- Simple issues: Use cached responses
- Complex issues: Full Claude analysis
- Escalated issues: Premium processing with full context

## Monitoring & Analytics

### 1. Cost Tracking
- Tokens used per ticket
- API costs per day/month
- Response generation success rate

### 2. Quality Metrics
- Agent modification rate
- Customer satisfaction correlation
- Response accuracy scores

### 3. Documentation Health
- Coverage gaps identified
- Outdated content flagged
- New documentation suggestions

## Integration Points

### 1. HelpScout Webhooks
- Listen for new customer messages

### 2. HelpScout Docs API
- Fetch articles and categories
- Monitor for documentation updates
- Push suggested documentation changes

### 3. Agent Interface

**Week 3-4**: Claude integration, basic response generation
**Week 5-6**: Learning system, agent feedback loop
**Week 7-8**: Documentation intelligence, optimization
**Week 9-10**: Testing, refinement, launch

## Expected ROI

- **Cost**: ~$81/month for AI + development time
- **Savings**: 30% faster response times = ~20 hours/month agent time
- **Quality**: More consistent, documentation-backed responses
- **Documentation**: Self-updating knowledge base saves maintenance time

This system will transform your support operations while staying well within budget and providing measurable improvements to both agent efficiency and customer satisfaction.
