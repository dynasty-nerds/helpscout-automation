## Learnings

### Response Patterns That Work

- Keep responses empathetic and professional
- Acknowledge the customer's frustration before providing solutions
- Provide specific next steps, not just general guidance
- Include relevant links to documentation when helpful

### Response Patterns That Don't Work

- Generic responses that don't address the specific issue
- Too technical or jargon-heavy explanations  
- Responses that assume too much technical knowledge
- Not acknowledging the customer's emotional state

### Customer Issue Categories

#### Billing/Subscription Issues
- Always check subscription status first
- Offer prorated refunds when appropriate
- Explain billing cycles clearly
- Agents can process refunds and subscription changes directly

#### Technical Issues
- Ask for specific browser/device information
- Provide step-by-step troubleshooting
- Escalate to development team if needed

#### Account Access Issues
- Verify identity before providing account information
- Guide through password reset process
- Check for suspended accounts

## Notes for Improvement
